# Project description
## Short description
The idea is to make an online library website. Online library will have next functionality: login of users to the system, new or already registered users. Each user will see a list of books that have been borrowed, when they were borrowed and by when they should be returned. Users will be able to see which books are available on online loan, and if a book is available, they will be able to borrow.
